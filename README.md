The Odin Project Recipes

This is a basic HTML project consisting of an index page that links to several recipes. By the nend of this project, I will have solidified my understanding of basic HTML.

Takeaways: Basic HTML is not too bad, and VSCode really helps as an IDE with its autocomplete features. The hardest part of the project was remembering the "boilerplate" HTML, though VSCode can put that in automatically anyways.
